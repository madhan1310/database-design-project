# Superstore Sales System Database Design Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Supermarket Sales System Database Design Project repository. This project focuses on designing and implementing a normalized database schema for a supermarket sales system. The contents include the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) in MySQL Workbench format and a detailed project report.

## Contents

- **ERD.mwb**: MySQL Workbench file containing the Entity Relationship Diagram.
- **ProjectReport.pdf**: Report detailing the database design and implementation.

## Project Goals

The primary goal of this project was to create an optimized database schema for a supermarket sales system. The key components include:

- Identification of 7 key entities.
- Definition of attributes, relationships, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints in the ERD.
- Translation of the ERD model into a relational schema.
- Normalization of the schema to BCNF.
- Sample queries to test the schema.
- Sample data import and validation checks.

## ERD Overview

The ERD provides a visual representation of the database schema, highlighting the relationships and constraints among the identified entities.

## Project Report Highlights

The project report delves into the following aspects:

- Translation of the ERD model into a relational schema.
- Steps for normalizing the schema to bcNF.
- Sample queries for testing the schema.
- Sample data import procedures and validation checks.
  
- **Statistical Analysis:**
  - Calculated mean and standard deviation for numeric columns.

- **Join Queries:**
  - Demonstrated functionality through join queries:
    1. Region and transaction tables are joined to find region-wise total sales.
    2. Product, category, and transaction tables are joined to find category-wise total profit.
    3. Customer and transaction tables are joined to find the name of the customer with the highest sales.

## Usage

- **Viewing ERD**: The ERD can be opened and viewed using MySQL Workbench or any ERD visualization software.

- **Project Report**: For detailed insights into the design and implementation process, refer to the Project Report (ProjectReport.pdf).

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the process of designing and implementing an optimized database schema for a supermarket sales system. Feel free to explore the ERD and project report for a deeper understanding of the schema and its functionalities.
