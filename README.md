Translating the ERD model into a relational schema
Steps for normalizing the schema to 3NF
Sample queries to test the schema
Sample data import and validation checks
Overall, this project demonstrates the process of designing an optimized database schema and testing it with sample data.

Usage
The ERD can be viewed using MySQL Workbench or any ERD visualization software
The report provides additional details on the implementation and testing process
